                                       iteration count. This has no impact on synthesis, only on reporting.
  set_directive_occurrence           - Used when pipelining functions or loops, to specify that the code in a location
                                       is executed at a lesser rate than the code in the enclosing function or loop
  set_directive_performance          - Allows a single pragma to parallelize a loop nests based on a performance target,
                                       and can be accomplished by internally applying pipeline, unroll, and array
                                       partition pragmas to the associated loops/arrays.

  set_directive_resource             - Directive RESOURCE
  set_directive_shared               - Specifies that a global variable, or function argument array is shared among
                                       multiple dataflow processes, without the need for synchronization.
  set_directive_stable               - Indicates that a variable input or output of a dataflow region can be ignored

                                       instructions that can then be scheduled independently
