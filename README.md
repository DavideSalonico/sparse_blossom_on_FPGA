# Sparse Blossom on FPGA - HPPS Project @ Polimi
High Performance Processors and Systems course project at Politecnico di Milano

## Abstract
Quantum Computing is a new paradigm of computation that allows for an exponential speedup with respect to classical computing, over a noticeable number of scenarios. Unfortunately, current quantum hardware is affected by noise, which reduces performance. In this work, we aim to accelerate one of the state-of-the-art techniques for error correction: the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching. We target FPGAs as a heterogeneous architecture that exploits task-level and data-level parallelism to reduce execution time.

## File structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- src folder contains all the source files used in the project
- delieveries contains the documentation incuding a report and slides that will be used in the oral presentation
- utils contains a script for generating a nodes.json file (there is also one provided as an example)

## Full Report
The full report is available [here](./path_to_report).
